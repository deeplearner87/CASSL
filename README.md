# CASSL
A cell-type annotation method for single cell transcriptomics data using semi-supervised learning. This project aims at learning cell annotations for missing cell labels via NMF and recursive k-Means clustering. - Accepted for publication in Applied Intelligence, Springer

To test CASSL on datasets with missing annotations, run CASSL.ipynb. 

To validate CASSL on datasets with no missing annotations, run CASSL_Validation.ipynb. Go to "Remove p% labels" sub-section and set the percentage of cells to be used for training.
